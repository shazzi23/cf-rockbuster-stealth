# Rockbuster Stealth
This repository contains code extracts from a **data analysis project** I worked on as part of the [Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) Data Analytics Bootcamp.

[Visualisations](https://public.tableau.com/views/RockbusterStealthViz/RockbusterStealthVisualisations?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) for this project can also be viewed on Tableau Public.

## Project Brief
Rockbuster Stealth, a fictional movie rental company, is making the transition from physical stores to online streaming in order to stay relevant. To aid this transition, the board answers to the following questions:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Learning outcomes
The main purpose of this project was to develop my knowledge of **SQL** and **relational databases**, and to familiarise myself with platforms such as **PostgreSQL**.
