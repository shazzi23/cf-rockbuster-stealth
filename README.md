# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project
This repository contains code extracts from a data analysis project I worked on as part of the [Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) Data Analysis Bootcamp.

## Project Brief ##
Rockbuster Stealth, a fictional movie rental company, is making the transition from physical stores to online streaming in order to stay relevant.



You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
Before you can begin your analysis and answer more complex business questions, you’ll need to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. You’ll eventually compile the results of your analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
